# knowing index position is an important part of 
# Array data as it goes outside the norm of general understanding
# of daily-use numerical sequence. Being mindful that
# Array sequence starts with the first element (what's inside the brackets) 
# being viewed as number 0 is important to remember if you 
# wish to call on the correct element you're trying to reach. 
# EXAMPLE: if we were to have our elements be, [1,2,3,4], 
# to call on the number 3, we would call on [2] vs [3]. 
# If we had elements, [9,8,7,6], and wanted to call number 9,
# we would call [0] vs [1].
